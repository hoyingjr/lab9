  <h1>LCB Finance Program</h1>
  <h2>Jacob Hoying</h2>
  <p>Finance is an analytical discipline focusing on critical decisions faced by individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. It integrates disciplines, drawing on economics as the basis of its theory, accounting as the basis for understanding the information used in the decision making process and the tools of quantitative analysis for the analytical work. An understanding of financial theory and practice evolves to serve as a basis for either entering a financial position in the work force or continuing with graduate studies.
